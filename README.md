## Development

Toolbelt is a static single-page web application. Build the web application using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
# Build in "watch" mode, launch local dev server
yarn run dev

# Build the app in production mode
yarn run build
```

Be sure to run in production mode before making any pull requests, as the `docs` folder is used by GitHub to host all content for [tbelt.io](https://tbelt.io/).
